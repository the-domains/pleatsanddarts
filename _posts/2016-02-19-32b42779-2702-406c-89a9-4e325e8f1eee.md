Esther Honig:  Beauty Perceptions
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/54093cf2-284f-46d5-82b4-1ff866ae106c.jpg)

## Our perceptions of what is "natural" and what is "fabricated" have become increasingly blurred in our technical world. The theory of art(ifice) becomes increasingly important. In the mid-19th century, art took on a perspective as an improver of nature. Landscape gardeners like the Englishman Capability Brown pushed and pulled the countryside to make it more and more like the natural state. Nature wasn't even good enough to be itself. In contrast, the hyper-organized parterres and forced perspective boulevard in the manner of Haussmann and Le NÃ´tre defied the the loose visual organisation of the natural world into a man-made concept of beauty which was entirely unnatural.
Photoshop, Instagram and any number of powerful yet nimble programs has made us question what is true in any picture of a person. The controversy of regarding the photoshopping of models for commercial publication has been the bete noire of the fashion retailing industry. As we adjust our world to fit our comfort zone, there is a loss of our link to these natural processes.
"The more we study Art, the less we care about Nature."
